A New Graph Traversal Algorithm. A novel traversal approach that combines BFS and DFS adaptively for better efficiency in certain types of graphs.

> Adaptive-BFS (A-BFS) is an enhanced version of Breadth-First Search (BFS) that dynamically adjusts its traversal strategy based on the structure of the graph. Unlike standard BFS, which explores all neighbors level by level in a strict queue-based manner, A-BFS adapts based on factors such as degree centrality, clustering, or priority metrics.

### üß¨ Key Characteristics of A-BFS
1. **Priority-Based Expansion**  
    - Instead of processing nodes purely in FIFO (First-In, First-Out) order, A-BFS prioritizes high-degree or important nodes first.
2. **Dynamic Expansion Strategy**  
    - A-BFS switches between BFS and more selective expansions based on graph properties like node connectivity or depth.
3. **Reduced Redundant Exploration**  
    - By intelligently prioritizing certain nodes, A-BFS reduces unnecessary expansions, making it more efficient than traditional BFS.
4. **Better Performance on Large Graphs**  
    - A-BFS can be faster than BFS in graphs where certain nodes act as central hubs or where traversal costs need optimization.

### üîé Problem with Existing Traversals
- BFS (Breadth-First Search) explores level by level but consumes too much memory in wide graphs.
- DFS (Depth-First Search) is memory efficient but gets stuck in deep branches in some cases.
  
### üìå Concept of Adaptive-BFS (A-BFS)
- **Hybrid Approach:** Start with BFS, but dynamically switch to DFS when encountering a dense local structure (i.e., many neighbors).
- **Adaptive Depth Control:** A-BFS estimates whether to switch modes based on node degree and local density.
- **Efficient Memory Use:** Uses a limited queue like BFS but prunes unnecessary branches dynamically like DFS.

### üßø Why is A-BFS Unique?
- Dynamically Adjusts Traversal Strategy ‚Äì Instead of blindly following BFS or DFS, it adapts based on local density.
- More Memory Efficient than BFS ‚Äì Reduces unnecessary memory usage in wide graphs.
- Faster Exploration in Certain Graphs ‚Äì Handles irregular graphs better by intelligently switching modes.

## Mathematical Concept

## Mathematical Concept of A-BFS

Let **G = (V, E)** be a graph with:

- **V** as the set of nodes  
- **E** as the set of edges  

A traditional BFS explores nodes level by level:

\[
L_{i+1} = \{ v \in V \mid \exists u \in L_i, (u, v) \in E \}
\]

where **L_i** is the set of nodes visited at depth **i**.

In A-BFS, the expansion function is modified:

\[
L_{i+1} = \{ v \in V \mid \exists u \in L_i, (u, v) \in E, \text{Priority}(v) > \text{Threshold} \}
\]

where **Priority(v)** is a dynamic scoring function based on **node degree, betweenness centrality, or domain-specific weights**.

### A-BFS Pseudocode  
```
Algorithm A-BFS(Graph G, Start Node s): Input: Graph G = (V, E), Start node s Output: Ordered list of visited nodes
1:  Create a max-priority queue PQ
2:  Initialize a visited set: Visited ‚Üê {s}
3:  Insert (Priority(s), s) into PQ
4:  While PQ is not empty:
5:        Extract node u with the highest priority from PQ
6:        For each neighbor v of u:
7:            If v is not in Visited:
8:                Add v to Visited
9:                Compute Priority(v) = f(v) (e.g., degree-based)
10:               Insert (Priority(v), v) into PQ
11:  Return Visited
```
