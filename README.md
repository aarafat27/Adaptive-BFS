# Adaptive-BFS (A-BFS)
### A New Graph Traversal Algorithm

A novel traversal approach that combines BFS and DFS adaptively for better efficiency in certain types of graphs.

### Problem with Existing Traversals
- BFS (Breadth-First Search) explores level by level but consumes too much memory in wide graphs.
- DFS (Depth-First Search) is memory efficient but gets stuck in deep branches in some cases.
### Concept of Adaptive-BFS (A-BFS)
- **Hybrid Approach:** Start with BFS, but dynamically switch to DFS when encountering a dense local structure (i.e., many neighbors).
- **Adaptive Depth Control:** A-BFS estimates whether to switch modes based on node degree and local density.
- **Efficient Memory Use:** Uses a limited queue like BFS but prunes unnecessary branches dynamically like DFS.

### Why is A-BFS Unique?
- Dynamically Adjusts Traversal Strategy – Instead of blindly following BFS or DFS, it adapts based on local density.
- More Memory Efficient than BFS – Reduces unnecessary memory usage in wide graphs.
- Faster Exploration in Certain Graphs – Handles irregular graphs better by intelligently switching modes.
